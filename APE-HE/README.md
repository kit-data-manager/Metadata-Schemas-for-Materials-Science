This schema has been designed for the APE-HE (Advanced Photoelectric Effect - High Energy) metadata extraction. The photoelectric effect refers to the emission of electrons from a material expose to light. In these high-energy experiments, X-ray radiation is commonly used to excite the sample material.

This schema was used in the development of the map file(s) in:
- [ape_he_mapper](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/ape_he_mapper/tree/main/src/resources/maps/mapping).
