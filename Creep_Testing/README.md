# NFDI-MatWerk (IUC02) JSON schema for creep data of Ni-based superalloys

This JSON schema was developed within the infrastructure use case IUC02: “Framework for curation and distribution of reference datasets” of the consortium NFDI-MatWerk. It intends to define a structured approach for collecting all required information on a creep experiment using the established terminology of the respective test standard ISO 204:2022 and additional terminology agreed upon by the domain experts. The individual entries are grouped according to their content type and sub-summarized under respective headlines, thereby suggesting a basic categorization and a related hierarchy of concepts. This hierarchy can be similarly applied to other test methods and different metallic (and other) materials.

The development of schemas in this folder is based on a dataset, that can be found under [reference dataset by BAM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11668375). More details on the data schema is provided is also available in a git repository [IUC02 git repo](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/nfdi-matwerk/iuc02)).

With the JSON schema(v1.1), it is intended to define a structured approach for collecting all required information on a creep experiment using the established terminology of the respective test standard ISO 204:2022. The development goals encompass the following primary aspects:
- To ensure a comprehensive description with a hierarchical data structure that can be implemented to data management platforms,
- To define a scope of documentation that allows the assessment of a dataset’s quality by different end users who retrieve datasets from multiple data providers,
- To foster the exchange of high-quality creep datasets according to the FAIR principles, by providing easy interoperability and full reusability.
