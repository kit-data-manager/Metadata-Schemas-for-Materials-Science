# LAB CT Schema
- This JSON Schema describes a nano- or micro-Computed Tomography (CT) measurement performed in a laboratory using an X-ray tube as the source.  
- The same schema can also be applied to Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)-based CT measurements, where X-rays emitted from a material under interaction with the electron beam of a SEM are used to generate CT images of a sample.
