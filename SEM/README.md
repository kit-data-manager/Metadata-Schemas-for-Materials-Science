# SEM Schema
- This folder contains schemas for complying with the extraction of metadata from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) acquisitions.  
The schemas are provided in two formats: `JSON` and `XSD`.  
- The SEM schema defines the structure and rules for metadata describing SEM image acquisitions, ensuring consistency, interoperability, and validation across different datasets and tools.

# Usage
- The **SEM_schema.json** is used in the development of SEM map file(s) in [tomo_mapper](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/tomo_mapper/tree/main/src/resources/maps/mapping).
