# Metadata-Schemas-for-Materials-Science
*********************************************

The aim of this repository is to house the metadata schemas for different measurement techniques used in Materials Science. 
The schemas are written according to the JavaScript Object Notation (`JSON`) Schema or the XML Schema Definition (`XSD`) format.
Sample files are also provided which are written according to the respective schemas.

## List of available Schemas:

1. Schema for scanning electron microscopy ([SEM](./SEM))
1. Schema for transmission electron microscopy ([TEM](./TEM))
1. Schema for magnetic resonance imaging ([MRI](./MRI))
1. Schemas for [SEM-FIB_Tomography](./SEM-FIB_Tomography)
1. Schema for nano or micro - computed tomography ([CT](./CT)) 
1. Schema for Advanced Photoelectric Effect - High Energy ([APE-HE](./APE-HE))
1. General Schemas
